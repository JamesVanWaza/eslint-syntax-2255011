[COURSEDESCRIPTION]

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `01_03` corresponds to the first chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `master` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

## Folders
The files are divided into two folders, which represent 2 separate projects:
  - The `ErrorChecking` folder contains the project used in videos 01_01 through 01_06.
  - The `Challenge` folder contains the project used in videos 01_07 and 01_08.
